# 🛡️ Penetration Testing Report – Ethical Hacking Simulation

## 📘 Project Overview
This project simulates a **real-world black-box penetration test** on two virtual machines within an isolated `/24` network (`192.168.225.0/24`). It demonstrates the complete ethical hacking lifecycle: from **network reconnaissance** and **vulnerability assessment** to **exploitation** and **risk mitigation**, following industry best practices.

> ✅ Successfully exploited **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)** vulnerability  
> ✅ Gained access to **unauthenticated SMB file shares** on a Linux server  
> ✅ Delivered a professional report with screenshots, risk scores, and fixes
